## 📖 About the Project

Mpesa Analyzer is designed to automatically parse your MPESA transaction SMS messages and provide visual insights into your spending habits. By utilizing modern Android development best practices, the application offers a smooth, responsive, and intuitive way to manage personal finances directly from your device without manual entry.

### 🔗 Architecture & Integration
The mobile app relies on a decoupled architecture, consuming RESTful APIs served by a customized **CodeIgniter 4 (CI4)** backend. The backend infrastructure, including the **MySQL** database and **phpMyAdmin** interface, is fully containerized using **Docker** for easy local development, testing, and deployment.

**Key Highlights:**
* **MVVM Architecture:** Ensures separation of concerns, making the UI logic highly testable and maintainable.
* **Coroutines & Flow:** Handles asynchronous data streams seamlessly without blocking the main thread.
* **Robust Backend:** A lightweight, blazing-fast CI4 API providing secure data access.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Automated SMS Parsing:** Reads and categorizes MPESA transaction messages securely.
* **Visual Analytics:** Interactive Pie Charts to visualize spending distribution.
* **Offline Processing:** All data extraction happens locally on the device for maximum privacy.
* **Background Syncing:** Automatically uploads categorized data to your personal CI4 backend.
* **Dark Mode Support:** Fully responsive adaptive UI following Material Design 3 guidelines.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* **Android Studio:** Giraffe (or newer)
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 17+
* **Docker Desktop:** Installed and running (for backend services)
* **Git:** For version control

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/Mpesa_Analyzer_App.git
cd Mpesa_Analyzer_App
```

### 2. Set Up the CodeIgniter 4 Backend (Docker)
The backend runs entirely in Docker containers. From the backend project directory:
```bash
# Build and start the containers in the background
docker-compose up -d --build

# Check if containers are running properly
docker-compose ps
```
* **API Endpoint:** The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api/` (adjust port as needed).
* **Database Management:** Access phpMyAdmin at `http://localhost:8081` using the credentials defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.

### 3. Configure the Android App
Open the Android project in Android Studio. You need to point the app to your local backend.
1. Open `local.properties` (or `gradle.properties` depending on your setup).
2. Add your local IP address for the API Base URL:
```properties
# Use 10.0.2.2 for the Android Emulator to connect to localhost
BASE_URL="http://10.0.2.2:8080/api/"

# Use your machine's physical IP address if testing on a physical device
# BASE_URL="http://192.168.1.xxx:8080/api/" 
```
3. Click **Sync Project with Gradle Files**.

### 4. Run the App
* **Using the Emulator:** Select your preferred AVD in Android Studio and hit **Run** (`Shift + F10`).
* **Using a Physical Device:** Connect your Android device via USB (ensure USB Debugging is enabled), select your device in the deployment target dropdown, and hit **Run**.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

* **Build Variants:** The project utilizes Gradle build variants (`debug` and `release`). Ensure you select the `debug` variant for local development.
* **Environment Variables:** Production URLs and sensitive API keys should be injected securely via CI/CD pipelines and not hardcoded into the repository.
